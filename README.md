# c8def

[sqldef](https://github.com/k0kubun/sqldef) for CockroachDB

## Motivation

CockroachDB's compatibility with PostgreSQL is excellent, but there are some differences: e.g. https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/65885.

## Status

This library is very experimental. It will exterminate cockroaches.
